# Challenge 1: Palindrome Checker
# Write an algorithm that takes a string and returns True if it's a palindrome 
# (reads the same forward and backward), otherwise False)

palindrome = input("Enter a word: ")
print(palindrome == palindrome[::-1])

# Challenge 2: Domain from Email
# Write an algorithm that takes an email address through user input and returns the domain 
# (everything after the @ symbol).


email = input("Enter an email address: ")



# Challenge 3: First and Last Match
# Given a list of strings, return True if the target matches the last element in the list.

given_list = ["blue", "pink", "purple", "red"]
user_answer = input("Enter a color that could be at the end of the list: ")
if given_list[-1] == user_answer:
    print("True")
else:
    print("False")

# Challenge 4: Conditional Suffix Adder
# Write an algorithm that takes a string.

word = input("Enter a word: ")
if word[-3:1] != "gni":
    print(word + "ing")
elif word[-3:1] == "gni":
    print(word + "ly")
elif len(word) < 3:
