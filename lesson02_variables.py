#Variable name must be meaningful 
# For math problems: 

x = 3.14

#Variables are flexable, you create or update another variable like so:

count_down = count - 1
print(count_down)
count = count_down
print(count)
count_down = count -1
print(count_down)

#Challenge 1: rename variables 
# Change the variable names x, y, z belowe to more descriptive names.
